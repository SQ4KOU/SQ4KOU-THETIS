# Clean synthesis provenance

Created: 2026-09-04

Ramdor reference:
- branch: base/ramdor-20260904
- commit: 852bf0ef0b4f3886a13fc2846489aee16f361872

EU2AV reference:
- branch: base/eu2av-20260904
- commit: 567a7ecd88bfb2ca41316dab9258fff0efeae7bf

Initial candidate strategy:
- technical tree starts from the EU2AV pinned snapshot;
- EU2AV branding and editor backup artifacts are removed;
- upstream copyright, license and contributor attribution are preserved;
- no SQ4KOU functional patches are permitted in Stage 1;
- feature-by-feature semantic audit follows after the first clean x64 build.


Integrated Ramdor delta:
- `8071b543e2565b959cd60512eacda154d0873ad2` — N1MM CW spectrum shift option only.
- Functional logic from Ramdor `N1MM.cs` retained.
- Setup control integrated programmatically to preserve EU2AV Setup designer additions.
- Package upgrades, app.config changes, unrelated test cleanup, branding and release-note edits from the Ramdor commit were deliberately excluded.
